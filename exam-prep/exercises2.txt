//Exercise 13

app.use(logger)

//Exercise 14

Parsing the body request
app.use(express.json())                             ----- handles json
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }))    ----- handles forms

//Exercise 15

Option 3 - (status(401))

//Exercise 16

It means it's hashed 10 rounds.

The second argument (10 in this case) is the cost factor that determines how many iterations of the algorithm is performed.

Coverage

--------THEORY--------
JEST and React Testing Library CAN do:
- Component Testing
- Unit Testing

JEST additionally can do:
- logic testing
- coverage

RTL:
- test DOM interactions
- end-to-end testing
- integration testing

//Exercise 19

This test checks if a component is rendering without issues.
A smoke test is a type of software testing 
that determines whether the deployed software build is stable or not.

//Exercise 20

Currently both of them are of type "any"

We fix this by adding annotations:

const addTwoNumbers = (a:number, b:number) => {
    return a + b;
};

//Exercise 21

Option 1 is incorrect.
The rest is compilable in TypeScript.

//Exercise 22

Option 3 is incorrect.

//Exercise 23 
    // How do we ensure that makeUser ALWAYS returns a user?
    
    interface User {
        id: number;
        firstName: string;
        lastName: string;
      }  

      const makeUser = (): User => {
        return {
            id: 1,
            firstName: "Nina",
            lastName: "Wrona"
        };
      };

//Exercise 24

No, Because this function returns a Promise.

interface LukeSkywalker {
  name: string;
}

export const fetchLukeSkywalker = async (): Promise<LukeSkywalker> => {
  const data = await fetch('https://swapi.dev/api/people/1').then((res) => {
    return res.json();
  });

  return data;
};

------Other valid solutions-------

//option 2
const fetchLukeSkywalker = async () => {
  const data: LukeSkywalker = await fetch(
    "https://swapi.dev/api/people/1"
  ).then((res) => {
    return res.json();
  });

  return data;
};

//option 3

const fetchLukeSkywalker = async () => {
  const data = await fetch("https://swapi.dev/api/people/1").then((res) => {
    return res.json();
  });

  return data as LukeSkywalker;
};

//Exercise 25

The Record type allows us to add any number of dynamic keys to the object at runtime, 
using something like this:

cache['keyHere'] = 'valueHere'

//Exercise 26
 
 Option 4 is incorrect

//Exercise 27

Option 2 is incorrect

//Exercise 28

NO - because in Typescript ALL ASYNC functions return Promises.
This is the correct syntax:

async function dramaticWelcome(): Promise<void> {
    console.log("Hello")
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        const count: number = await delay(500, i)
        console.log(count)
    }
    console.log("World!")
}

//Exercise 29 

  "2 unread messages" will be printed out.
  
  && operator in React stands for "if" operation.

//Exercise 30

Option 1 is correct as in props (React arguments) functions must be passed, not called.

//Exercise 31

Module bundling is a build step before code reaches the browser.
Achieved with build tools such as Webpack and ESBuild.
Minifies modules and their dependencies and bundles them into a single file.

//Exercise 32

TRUE STATEMENTS
React is used to make single page web applications.
React uses Virtual DOM.
JSX allows developers to write HTML-like code in their JavaScript files.
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript.
Babel is a JavaScript compiler that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ 
code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript that can run 
in current and older browsers or environments. 

//Exercise 33
Yes, it is valid.

//Exercise 34
Yes, it's valid, because the empty array tells React to run 
useEffect ONLY on the first render.

//Exercise 35
It's incorrect runs useEffect on every render and those renders are triggered
by the setCount() - state change.
